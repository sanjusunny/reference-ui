# Project Guidelines

- Always check for guidance from the awslabs.frontend-mcp-server MCP server when implementing new features or adding new pages
- Always keep the README.md in sync with new capabilities
- Always use shadcn UI components if a component is available in the shadcn registry vs. creating custom components
- Always prefer using global Zustand store vs. creating local state or passing props
- Keep your updates minimal and focused
- Check project files before suggesting structural or dependency changes
- When adding new features, don't complete the analysis prematurely, continue analyzing even if you think you found a solution
- Ensure the code is complete and pages and components for new features are implemented fully and connected with the rest of the application
